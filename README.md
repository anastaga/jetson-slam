### Neural Network Training and Optimization
- Employ pretrained Yolov8 for RPN, re-trained on ~10,000 thermal images.
- Balance efficiency and accuracy for real-time human detection.

### Hardware Implementation and Calibration
- Transition to real-world application with Jetson Xavier NX.
- Integrate COIN417G2 thermal camera and Realsense d435i.

### Flight Control and SLAM System Integration
- Connect with Cube Orange flight controller via MAVROS.
- Refine system to send back obstacle data for navigation and receive IMU data.

### Algorithm Customization
- Tailor Yolov8 for real-time processing on Jetson Xavier NX.

### Flight Test
- Test flights showcased system functionality and efficiency in complex environments.


## TO INSTALL THE BASE SLAM WE USED, ALONG WITH THE REALSENSE D435i CAMERA INTEGRATION ON JETSON XAVIER NX


## Install Ros Melodic
	sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
	sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
	curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop
	sudo apt install ros-melodic-cv-bridge
	sudo apt install ros-melodic-ddynamic-reconfigure
	sudo apt install ros-kinetic-pcl-ros
	echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc
	sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
	sudo apt install python-rosdep
	sudo rosdep init
	rosdep update
	echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
	
**Download SYNAPTIC Package manager to remove OpenCV 4.1**. If it doesnt work after the installation of ros-melodic. Then use Synaptic to install the necessary dependancies.
Check OPENCV version: ```dpkg -l | grep libopencv```

# Thermal Camera and Human Presence Detection

Due to the proprietary nature of the thermal camera's APK, we are unable to share the specific code we developed. However, we provide a general outline of our methodology below.

## Process Overview

### 1. Image Acquisition and Conversion
The process begins with acquiring an image from the thermal camera. This image is then converted into a format compatible with OpenCV for further processing.

### 2. ROS Node Initialization
A ROS (Robot Operating System) node is established to initiate the entire process. This node is crucial for managing the image data and interfacing with other system components.

### 3. Utilizing Yolov8 for Object Detection
For human detection, we utilized a pretrained Yolov8 model, specifically its lightweight version, to balance processing efficiency with accuracy. Our model was trained on a dataset of approximately 10,000 thermal images, including both human and non-human subjects, sourced from various online resources.

### 4. Training and Configuration
The training phase was conducted with careful attention to ensure the model configurations were set appropriately for accurate human detection.

### 5. Setting Up the Jetson Xavier NX
A virtual environment was set up on the Jetson Xavier NX, tailored to the specific Python version required for Yolov8. All necessary libraries and requirements were installed, following the guidelines on the [Yolov8 GitHub page](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

### 6. ROS Node for Image Processing
We developed a ROS node that subscribes to the Thermal Camera Node. This node processes the thermal image through the Yolov8 network to detect human presence.
